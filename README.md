# MineWorlds Plugins

These plugins were originally developed for the server **MineWorlds (mineworlds.net)**.  

⚠️ Warning: The so-called "owners" of MineWorlds — **oz.tea (Brian Fowler), and his brother Brad Fowler (Glibs)** — are nothing but scammers.  
They scammed me for **€155**, refusing to pay for the work they demanded. Their behavior is unprofessional, dishonest, and completely pathetic.  

This repository exists to expose their lies and to make sure the community knows exactly who they are.  
Absolutely **do not trust them, do not work with them, and do not waste your time on their projects.**
